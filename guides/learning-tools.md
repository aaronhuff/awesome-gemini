# Gemini Learning Tools Guide

Gemini is not just a powerful AI assistant, it's also a great learning companion. With its new learning tools, you can deepen your understanding of complex topics, study more effectively, and bring your learning to life with visuals.

## Guided Learning

Guided Learning is a new mode in the Gemini app that acts as your personal AI learning companion. Instead of just giving you quick answers, it breaks down problems step-by-step and adapts explanations to your needs. This helps you uncover the "how" and "why" behind concepts.

### How to use Guided Learning

To use Guided Learning, simply ask Gemini a question about a topic you want to learn about. Gemini will then guide you through the topic with a series of questions and explanations.

**Example Prompt:**

> Can you help me understand the process of photosynthesis?

## Integrated Visuals

Gemini now automatically integrates high-quality images, diagrams, and YouTube videos directly into its responses. This makes the learning experience richer and more engaging.

### How it works

When you ask Gemini about a complex topic, it will proactively weave in visuals to help you understand more easily. For example, if you ask about the parts of a cell, Gemini might show you a diagram of a cell with all the parts labeled.

**Example Prompt:**

> Show me a diagram of the human heart.
