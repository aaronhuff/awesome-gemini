# Developer Assistant Guide

This guide provides an overview of how to leverage large language models and AI-powered tools to accelerate your development workflow. The focus is on three key areas: the Gemini command-line interface (CLI), the Jules AI software engineer, and Gemini integrations within your Integrated Development Environment (IDE).

## 1. Gemini CLI

The Gemini CLI brings the power of Google's most capable models to your terminal. It's a versatile tool for quick questions, code generation, and scripting.

### Key Use Cases:

*   **Quick Code Snippets:** Generate code for a specific task without leaving your terminal.
    *   `gemini "write a python function to check if a number is prime"`
*   **Command-Line Help:** Get help with shell commands, git, or other CLI tools.
    *   `gemini "how to find all files larger than 1GB in my current directory?"`
*   **Summarize Code:** Quickly understand a file's purpose.
    *   `cat my_script.py | gemini "summarize this python script"`
*   **Scripting and Automation:** Use the Gemini CLI in your shell scripts to automate complex tasks.

### Installation and Setup:

*Follow the official installation instructions for the Gemini CLI.*

## 2. Jules: Your AI Software Engineer

Jules is an AI agent designed to work as a software engineer on your team. It can understand user requests, create and execute plans, and use a variety of tools to complete coding tasks.

### How to Work with Jules:

1.  **Provide a Clear Goal:** Start with a clear and concise description of the task you want Jules to accomplish. This could be a bug report, a feature request, or a request to write tests.
2.  **Review the Plan:** Jules will propose a step-by-step plan. Review it carefully and provide feedback if necessary.
3.  **Monitor Progress:** Jules will provide updates as it completes each step of the plan. It will use tools to read and write files, run tests, and install dependencies.
4.  **Provide Feedback:** If Jules gets stuck or makes a mistake, provide guidance to help it get back on track.

### Best Practices:

*   **Be specific in your requests.** The more detail you provide, the better Jules will be able to understand and execute your request.
*   **Trust the process.** Jules is designed to be autonomous. Let it work through its plan, and only intervene if it's clear that it's going in the wrong direction.
*   **Use it for complex tasks.** Jules excels at tasks that require multiple steps and changes to multiple files.

## 3. Gemini in Your IDE

Integrating Gemini directly into your IDE (such as VS Code, JetBrains IDEs, etc.) provides real-time coding assistance.

### Core Features:

*   **Code Completion:** Get intelligent, context-aware code suggestions as you type.
*   **Code Generation:** Write a comment describing the code you need, and let Gemini generate it for you.
*   **Explain Code:** Highlight a block of code and ask Gemini to explain what it does.
*   **Find Bugs:** Ask Gemini to review your code for potential bugs or errors.
*   **Write Tests:** Generate unit tests for your functions and classes.

### Getting Started:

*   **Install the Extension:** Find the official Gemini extension in your IDE's marketplace.
*   **Log in:** Connect the extension to your Google account.
*   **Start Coding:** Use the features through keyboard shortcuts, right-click context menus, or the integrated chat window.

By combining the strengths of the Gemini CLI for quick tasks, Jules for complex projects, and IDE integration for real-time assistance, you can create a powerful and efficient development workflow.
