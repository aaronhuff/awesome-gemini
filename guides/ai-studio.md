# Google AI Studio Guide

Google AI Studio is a web-based tool that allows you to quickly prototype and test generative AI models. It's a great way to explore the capabilities of Gemini and other Google models without writing any code.

## Getting Started

1.  **Go to AI Studio:** Open your web browser and navigate to [https://aistudio.google.com/](https://aistudio.google.com/).
2.  **Sign in:** You'll need to sign in with your Google account.
3.  **Create a new prompt:** Once you're in, you can start creating new prompts. You can choose from different types of prompts, such as freeform prompts, structured prompts, and chat prompts.

## Key Features

*   **Model selection:** You can choose from a variety of Google's latest models, including the Gemini family of models.
*   **Prompt gallery:** AI Studio includes a gallery of pre-built prompts that you can use as a starting point for your own creations.
*   **API key generation:** You can easily generate an API key from AI Studio to use the models in your own applications.
*   **Code export:** AI Studio allows you to export your prompts as code snippets in various programming languages, such as Python, Node.js, and Go.

## Example Prompts & Workflows

### Example 1: Creative Writing Assistant

You can use AI Studio to help you with creative writing tasks. For example, you can ask it to write a short story, a poem, or a script.

**Prompt:**

> Write a short story about a robot who discovers music for the first time.

### Example 2: Content Summarization

AI Studio can be used to summarize long pieces of text. This is useful for quickly getting the gist of an article or a document.

**Prompt:**

> Summarize the following article about the benefits of exercise:
>
> [Paste a long article here]

### Example 3: Code Generation

You can use AI Studio to generate code in various programming languages.

**Prompt:**

> Write a Python function that takes a list of numbers and returns the sum of all the even numbers in the list.

## Advanced Workflows

### Chaining Prompts

You can chain multiple prompts together to create more complex workflows. For example, you could first generate a list of ideas for a blog post, then select one of those ideas and ask AI Studio to write an outline for it, and finally ask it to write the full blog post based on the outline.

### Fine-tuning Models (coming soon)

While not yet available for all models, AI Studio will eventually allow you to fine-tune models on your own data. This will allow you to create custom models that are tailored to your specific needs.
