# Google Workspace Aware Personal Assistant

This guide outlines the best practices for using a large language model as a personal assistant with deep integration into Google Workspace. The focus is on leveraging the model's ability to read and edit content across Google's suite of applications, using the `@` command as the primary method of interaction.

## Core Capabilities

Your personal assistant has two primary functions when interacting with Google Workspace:

1.  **Reading:** The assistant can read and comprehend information from your documents, emails, spreadsheets, and presentations. This allows it to answer questions, summarize content, and find information quickly.
2.  **Editing:** The assistant can make changes to your files, such as drafting emails, adding content to documents, creating new slides, or updating spreadsheets.

## The @ Command: Your Primary Tool

The most effective way to interact with your assistant is through the `@` command within Google Workspace applications. This command allows you to directly invoke the assistant and specify the context for its actions.

### How to Use the @ Command

1.  **Open the application:** Start in Gmail, Docs, Sheets, or Slides.
2.  **Type `@`:** This will bring up a list of smart chips, including people, files, and events.
3.  **Select the assistant:** Choose the Gemini/assistant smart chip.
4.  **Provide your instructions:** Clearly state what you want the assistant to do.

### Examples of @ Commands

**In Gmail:**

*   `@Gemini summarize the thread`
*   `@Gemini draft a reply to this email thanking the sender for their feedback.`
*   `@Gemini find all emails from [person's name] about the Q3 budget.`

**In Google Docs:**

*   `@Gemini write an introduction for a document about the benefits of remote work.`
*   `@Gemini summarize the last two pages of this document.`
*   `@Gemini create a table with three columns: "Task", "Owner", and "Deadline".`

**In Google Sheets:**

*   `@Gemini create a formula to calculate the average of cells B2 through B10.`
*   `@Gemini find all rows where the "Status" column is "Complete".`
*   `@Gemini create a chart based on the data in A1:B10.`

**In Google Slides:**

*   `@Gemini create a new slide with a title and a bulleted list.`
*   `@Gemini find a relevant image for this slide about "teamwork".`
*   `@Gemini summarize the key points from this presentation.`

## Best Practices for Clear Instructions

To get the best results from your assistant, follow these guidelines:

*   **Be specific:** Instead of saying "help with this doc," say "@Gemini summarize the key takeaways from this document."
*   **Provide context:** If you're referencing another file, use the `@` command to link to it directly (e.g., `@Gemini summarize the attached report`).
*   **Use natural language:** You don't need to use "computer language." Speak to the assistant as you would to a human assistant.
*   **Review and refine:** Always double-check the assistant's work. It's a powerful tool, but it's not infallible. Be prepared to make small edits or provide clarifying instructions.

By mastering the `@` command and providing clear instructions, you can turn your personal assistant into an invaluable partner for managing your work in Google Workspace.
